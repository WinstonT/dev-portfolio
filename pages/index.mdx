# About

<Navbar />

### Hello

My name is **Winston Tandi**, welcome to my slightly fancier resume!

I am a software engineer passionate about creating exciting products that can make a difference. I have previous experience working in fast-paced startups, where I led the development for multiple projects, as well as doing RnD at a large e-commerce company. When not typing code, I enjoy playing video games, drinking overpriced coffee and staring at cute dogs.

Feel free to reach out to me :)
